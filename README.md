# PARITY-SIMMETRY-CLASSIFICATION
Code of my first ML program, exploiting basic gradient descent to navigate the surface of the cost function in search for local minima
Hello everyone, 
since I am new to ML and AI, I've decided to share the results of my effort which, systematically,
grow with respect to complexity and completeness. For now, I am trying to avoid the use of frameworks in order to 
learn the basic algorithms underlying "intelligent" programs. Feel free to add constructive critiques

PARITY & SIMMETRY CLASSIFIER
The provided code is inclusive of a pattern generator, used for the creation of different types of patterns.
The algorithm exploits batch learning and, as a result, too large datasets may result in unwarranted slow down of PC performance. 
The Men√π will provide two main choices, which will allow you to select whether to perform 
learning on parity and simmetry simulataneously or individually.

Feel free to contact me.
